    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);
    age = 200
    console.log(age,age2); // will get 200 100, because the value of age goes into the variable at the same time
    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name,name2); // wesley wes. because the values of strings numbers and booleans go into it, and if you change the original one its ok, does not change the other value. AS OPPOSED TO AN ARRAY



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // team is not the array. its just  areference to the original array, which is players. when you edit/update the array, it goes back to the reference, which is not the same as what we did with numbers, strings
    

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // -> it references back to the original array

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead! rather than a reference. a few ways
    
    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice(); // if you pass it nothing, just returns the ensire array


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); // take a blank array, concat in the original array

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // will take every item out of the iterable and put it into the containing array. ie will copy into [...players]

    team[3] = 'heee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; //person is now 99, even tho person should be 80, if we update the number, we made a reference to the original one

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12} ); // start w a blank object, pass it the object you want to copy the properties from; then in a new argument, fold in your new properties you wish to overwrite and stick the entire thing in a const/variable.
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; // works the way you spread in an array, but you can spread into an object. 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
